weight=,,Name of field to read weight from. Applies weight field to both origins and destinations.
zonesums=,,Expressions to sum over zones (see zone sums below)
lenwt,,Specifies that weight field is per unit length
custommetric=,,Specified field name to read custom metric from
xytol=,,Manual override xy tolerance for fixing endpoint connectivity.  
ztol=,,Manual override z tolerance for fixing endpoint connectivity.  
outputgeodesics,,Output geometry of all pairwise geodesics in analysis (careful – this can create a lot of data)
outputdestinations,,Output geometry of all pairwise destinations in analysis (careful – this can create a lot of data).  Useful in combination with origins for creating a map of distance/metric from a given origin.
outputhulls,,Output geometry of all convex hulls in analysis 
outputnetradii,,Output geometry of all network radii in analysis
origins=,,"Only compute selected origins (provide feature IDs as comma separated list).  Useful in conjunction with outputgeodesicsm, outputdestinations, outputhulls, outputnetradii."
destinations=,,Only compute selected destinations (ditto)
nonetdata,,Don’t output any network data (used in conjunction with geometry outputs)
pre=,,Prefix text of your choice to output column names
post=,,Postfix text of your choice to output column names
nobetweenness,,Don’t calculate betweenness (saves a lot of time)
nojunctions,,Don’t calculate junction measures (saves time)
nohull,,Don’t calculate convex hull measures (saves time)
linkonly,,Only calculate individual link measures.  
outputsums,,"Output sum measures SAD, SCF etc as well as means MAD, MCF etc."
probroutes,,Output measures of problem routes – routes which exceed the length of the radius
forcecontorigin,,"Force origin link to be handled in continuous space, even in a discrete analysis.  Prevents odd results on very long links."
nqpdn=,1,Custom numerator power for NQPD equation
nqpdd=,1,Custom denominator power for NQPD equation
skipzeroweightorigins,,Skips calculation of any output measures for origins with zero weight.  Saves a lot of time if many such origins exist.
skipzeroweightdestinations,1,Zero weight destinations are skipped by default.  Note this will exclude them from geometry outputs; if this is not desired behaviour then set skipzeroweightdestinations=0
skiporiginifzero=,,"Specified field name.  If this field is zero, the origin will be skipped.  Allows full customization of skipping origins."
skipfraction=,1,"Set to value n, skips calculation for (n-1)/n origins.  Effectively the increment value when looping over origins."
skipmod=,0,Chooses which origins are calculated if skipfraction?1.  Effectively the initial value when looping over origins: every skipfractionth origin is computed starting with the skipmodth one.
nostrictnetworkcut,,Don’t constrain geodesics to stay within radius.  This will create a lot more ‘problem routes’.  Only alters behaviour of betweenness measures (not closeness).
probrouteaction=,ignore,"Take special action for problem routes that exceed the radius by a factor greater than probroutethreshold.  Can be set to ignore, discard or reroute.  Reroute changes geodesic to shortest Euclidean path.  Only alters betweenness output, not closeness."
probroutethreshold=,1.2,"Threshold over which probrouteaction is taken.  Note this does not affect computation of probroutes measures, which report on all routes which exceed the radius length regardless of this setting."
outputdecomposableonly,,output only measures which are decomposable i.e. can be summed over different origins (useful for parallelization)
linkcentretype=,"Angular for angular analysis, Euclidean otherwise",Override link centre types – angular or Euclidean
lineformula=,,Formula for line metric in hybrid analysis (see below)
juncformula=,0,Formula for junction turn metric in hybrid analysis (see below)
bidir,,Output betweenness for each direction separately
oneway=,,Specified field name to read one way data from (see note 1 below)
vertoneway=,,Specified field name to read vertical one way data from (see note 1 below)
oversample=,1,Number of times to run the analysis; results given are the mean of all runs.  Useful for sampling hybrid metrics with random components.
odmatrix,,Read OD matrix from input tables (a 2d table must be present)
zonedist=,euc,"Set expression to determine how zone weights are distributed over links in each zone, or 0 to skip distribution (all lines receive entire zone weight)"
intermediates=,,Set expression for intermediate link filter.  Geodesics are discarded unless they pass through link where expression is nonzero.
disable=,,Set expression to switch off links (links switched off when expression evaluates nonzero)
outputskim,,Output skim matrix file
skimorigzone,,Origin zone field (must be text) for skim matrix
skimdestzone,,Destination zone field (must be text) for skim matrix
skimzone,,Skim matrix zone field for both origin and destination (sets both skimorigzone and skimdestzone)
bandedradii,,Divide radius into bands: for each radius only include links outside the previous radius
datatokeep=,,List of field names for data to copy to output
